                        <p>Let me introduce myself. My name is Samantha Dutcher, and I have been a cook, among many
                            other things, in
                            the restaurant industry for the last 20 years. The restaurant industry is definitely not for
                            the
                            faint-hearted. I've had the amazing opportunity to work with some very memorable people who
                            have
                            mentored me and helped me to grow into the woman that I am today. I've learned everything I
                            needed to
                            know to be successful in a restaurant kitchen from them, from baking breads, pies, and other
                            desserts to
                            grilling, sauteeing, flambeing, and roasting delicious savory dishes.

                            <p>While I had good times, and definitely some bad ones, while working in restaurants, and
                                these
                                experiences helped shape me into the woman I am today, this is not who I am as a person.
                                Before I am
                                a chef, baker, or anything else, I am a mother before I everything else. I have three
                                beautiful
                                children, two of them are teenagers and one is a preteen now. Ever since my kids were
                                babies, I have
                                struggled to make sure they have everything they needed. As a single parent, everything
                                has become
                                so much harder as the years have gone by. During the Covid-19 lockdown last year, I had
                                the time I
                                needed to really sit back and reassess where we were heading in life and what we really
                                wanted.
                                After months of soul-searching I came to the decision that I needed a major career
                                change. I decided
                                to learn how to code, with the goal of becoming a fullstack web developer. Not only is
                                the salary
                                higher than I have ever made in my lifetime, but there is also job security in the
                                technology field,
                                and job security is what is most important to me now. </p>
